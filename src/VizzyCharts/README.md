# VizzyCharts
This repo holds a collection of React-based SVG components for making data viz charts. This package emphasizes Map based visualizations but cartesian charts made with [Observable Plot](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/plot) are coming soon.

## Map
This component provides a highly configurable map-based report for US Elections. It demonstrates the composition of various VizzyChart subcomponents for a specialized visualization experience. Configuration panels are revealed on hover. Chart elements can be drag and dropped. Future work includes inset support, more style options, and annotations.
